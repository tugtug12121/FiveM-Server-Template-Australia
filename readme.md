# 🚓 FiveM Server Website Template  
A cinematic, neon‑glass, police‑light‑themed landing page for modern FiveM communities.

This template is built for server owners who want a **high‑impact**, **immersive**, and **performance‑optimized** website that feels like a AAA game launcher.  
It includes advanced animations, parallax effects, neon UI components, and a modular Vue 3.5 architecture.
